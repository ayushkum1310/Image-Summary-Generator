# Image-Summary-Generator
"Image Summary Generator" is a Streamlit app. Upload an image, input a prompt, and get a summary generated by Google's Generative AI model.

Project Title: Image Summary Generator

Description:
The Image Summary Generator is a web application built using Streamlit that enables users to obtain concise and insightful summaries of uploaded images. Leveraging the power of Google's Generative AI (Gemini) model, this tool provides users with a comprehensive understanding of the visual content by generating textual summaries based on both the uploaded image and user-provided prompts.

Key Features:

Upload Image: Users can upload an image of their choice through the file uploader widget integrated into the application.
Input Prompt: In addition to the uploaded image, users can input specific prompts or questions related to the image content, enabling them to provide additional context for generating more relevant summaries.
Summary Generation: Upon submission, the application interacts with the Gemini model, passing along the uploaded image and user-input prompts. The model processes this information and generates a textual summary encapsulating the essence of the image and addressing the user's queries.
Visual Display: The uploaded image is prominently displayed within the application interface, allowing users to visually inspect the content they wish to analyze.
Response Display: The generated textual summary is presented within the application interface, enabling users to review and interpret the insights provided by the Gemini model.
User-Friendly Interface: The application features an intuitive and user-friendly interface, making it easy for users to interact with the tool and obtain valuable insights from their uploaded images.
Technologies Used:

Streamlit: Used as the primary framework for building the web application due to its simplicity and ease of use for developing interactive data applications.
Google's Generative AI (Gemini) Model: Integrated into the application to generate textual summaries based on uploaded images and user-provided prompts.
Python: The backend logic and application functionality are implemented using the Python programming language.
PIL (Python Imaging Library): Utilized for image processing tasks, such as loading and displaying images within the application.
dotenv: Used for managing environment variables, enabling secure storage and access to sensitive information such as API keys.
Heroku (Deployment): The application is deployed on the Heroku platform, allowing for easy access and usage by users.
Purpose:
The Image Summary Generator aims to provide users with a convenient and efficient means of summarizing and understanding the content of uploaded images. Whether for educational, research, or practical purposes, the tool empowers users to gain valuable insights and extract meaningful information from visual data with ease.
